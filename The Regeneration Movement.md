Like the rivers crossing our landscapes, there are many currents informing and evolving this important line of work. Whether heard in song at campfires, bonding and healing hearts, or recognised in food forests abundant with care and luscious produce, regeneration is in life-giving relationship with its contexts.

Formally, influences include permaculture and agro-ecology, living systems science and systems thinking, biomimicry, and ecological design at large. Perhaps most significantly of all, regeneration is the practice of remembering we are at all times part of and nested among intricate webs of relations on a living planet: a practice that has been held for thousands of years by many indigenous ways of being and knowing. 

This work takes root in community among local networks of organisers, as well as at conferences and talks, where care is being given to reconcile the nuanced distinctions between the many voices needed to co-create life-affirming futures. 

At the Astralship, we're diligently growing our understanding of these rich histories of practices, as well as carefully crafting our own interpretations. We look to Transition Towns, to living labs, to sanctuary cities and unconferences. We seek out friends at festivals. We grow connections in all kinds of places, at all levels. We exchange film for food. And we're in a constant state of change.
