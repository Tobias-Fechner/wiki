Society is at an inflection point - this we agree upon. We need new ways of innovation to build the tools and structures for the better world that is on the horizon, while effectively and gradually disengaging from the current one. Ways that put wellbeing first, are regeneratively principled, and bring together not just science and art, but also spirituality in the pursuit of maximising collective synergies. This is the mandate that we, at the [[Astralship]], have taken upon ourselves for more than a decade - to provide spaces for regenerative innovation to thrive through a focus on co-creative practices.

This website is an invitation to anyone in the fields of systems change, at [[Stakeholder Scales|any scale]], to decide if if they'd like to collaborate with us on any aspect of our work - whether that's regenerative organisational development, designing and running innovation sprints, weaving mutually beneficial networks, or sharing skills to deliver specific outputs. We are a decentralised collective that has a love/hate relationship with consensus based decision-making, believes in proactively skewing tech towards societal betterment, and has strong feelings about what it truly means to be regenerative. 

So, what exactly do [[Current Crew|we]] do?

1. We run an [[Astralship|incubation facility]] in Snowdonia where we host physical innovation intensives, regenerative events and long-term residencies.
2. We are convening a 6 month-long [[The Prisma Season|co-innovation process]] focused on developing technology for the regenerative movement - from ecovillages to tech-teams, and from activists to non-profits.
3. We have been transforming and rebuilding our [[Sociocracy and Astralship|governance]], [[Asana|project management]], legal and [[Energy Accounting|incentivization]] processes (see also [[Voyaging Value Creation]]) to more greatly align with regenerative principles.
4. We intend to continue iterating and co-evolving our methodology for facilitating group innovation - the [[Astralship Core Patterns|Voyaging Methodology]].
