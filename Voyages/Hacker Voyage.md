**Who:** This retreat is designed for the unique and extraordinary individuals within our network of friendly hackers. Given the widespread awareness of Astralship, we anticipate a diverse and engaging group. We're excited to announce that Mitch Altman, founder of Noisebridge and a renowned figure in the hacker community, will be joining us for three weeks following the EMF Camp.

**When:** The retreat is scheduled from May 12th to June 21st. Note that there will be a brief intermission during this period as participants attend the EMF Camp.

**Why:** Our focus is on bringing together hackers who are not only aligned in their thinking but also bring with them networks of highly intelligent individuals passionate about positive change. This group is known for their valuable technical skills and their ability to self-organise, making this an ideal 'warm-up' voyage. Mitch Altman's presence will be significantly influential in guiding what could otherwise be a chaotic assembly. This retreat also presents an opportunity to capture valuable data and insights (Tabs has some exciting ideas in this regard). The self-organising proficiency of our participants ensures ease of organisation.

**What:** The core activity is hacking, with a creative twist. We plan to intertwine 'building projects at the ship to showcase at EMF Camp' with 'developing innovative projects for the ship itself'. We're considering themed weeks â€“ for instance, we've thought about inviting a Japanese expert in open-source brain-computer interfaces and are keen on involving AI hackers. While not everyone may adhere to these themes (herding hackers is NP Hard), having multiple themes could foster diverse clusters of self-organisation. We're also exploring a woodworking voyage, given the interest shown in this area.

**Logistics:** Our approach will be organic. Our goal is to fill all cabins, balancing the number of participants to avoid overcrowding. While we appreciate the charm of having a few 'hippies in hammocks', we also encourage participants to consider Airbnb options as we approach capacity.

**Costs:** The primary objective is to break even, as this voyage is more about testing the waters, fostering organic improvement, and making technological and creative enhancements. This includes significant work on our core technology, which will require skilled facilitation. We recognise that hackers value community-oriented initiatives that aren't primarily profit-driven. Therefore, while we encourage those who can afford it to pay a fair rate (including room costs), we also welcome donations from those who are more financially able. This approach not only supports the ship but also contributes to the broader hacker community. We aim to facilitate (not dictate) the direction of the projects to maximise their benefit to both the ship and the participants.
