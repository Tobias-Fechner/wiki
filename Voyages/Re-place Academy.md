# Background
Learning together means [[Pirating Interview#Onboarding Feed|trying out new shapes]].[^1] What makes [[The Prisma Season|communication]] difficult when a group of people work together on systemic innovations is it can feel like there's so many parts, and they're all moving at once. Mapping is one way to begin connecting across different contexts, yet many mapping endeavours - coming from the outside looking in - struggle to encourage an ever-richer depth and diversity of perspectives informing the shared reality in becoming. At Astralship, research is inseparable from living, and living inseparable from prototyping. Our work maps itself by design: [[Voyage Products]].
# Purpose
The Replace Academy voyage is where the practice of peer-to-peer (P2P) learning meets the development of multi-media, multi-scale, multi-perspectival graphing. We're bringing together a cohort of partners across the fields of (at least) collaborative writing, digital knowledge ecosystems, and user experience design. The purpose of this work is accessibility and contextuality of knowledge, and the visibility of learning. We think a voyage is the perfect medium through which to apply these new capabilities: 

1. Accessibility - where complexity becomes less about overwhelm and more riding the waves. At Astralship, we've had people passing through from all walks of life, on many different journeys, each bringing with them a unique contribution toward a more whole sense for being and knowing. 
2. Contextuality - where no one can be known without their relations. Being sensitive to the relational field is a daily lived experience aboard the ship. 
3. Visibility - seeing collaborative in-formation: a living process.

Our co-living, co-working environment is a great way to bring these multiple contexts involved in living and learning to the fore.

# Aims
This voyage is an opportunity for those working in the fields of knowledge commoning and learning to resource one another with different pieces of the puzzle. We aim to make visible the practice of P2P learning, required in all voyaging endeavours, by integrating across multiple modalities of collaboration: tasking (Asana), writing (Wikis), comms (Telegram) and media production. [[Re-place Academy]] is the voyage to develop the infrastructures supporting this emergent process.

# Possible Products
We don't know what will emerge during voyaging. Here we simply gesture toward some early anticipations.

- Developing knowledge #commoning infrastructure 
- P2P learning methodology that addresses three aspects of P2P learning: 
	1. Self-organising study circles: without a teacher, forming through common alignment of will around given learning objectives. (reference to Scandinavian study circles)
	2. Knowledge transfer/ cross-pollination: members of study groups seed learning potentials elsewhere. See also [[Sociocracy and Astralship]] and [[Voyaging Value Creation]].
	3. More personal, one-on-one dynamics, such as pair programming and onboarding, where there is direct exchange between two individuals.

# Describing the Image
Arriving on the ship for the Replace Academy voyage is like going to a magical mystery theatre play - LARP (live-action role-play). There's a Russian scientist who's been working on fluid mechanics for 40 years. There's a 16 year old activist from Morocco. There's some local Welsh guy. When you turn up, you're also meeting these amazing people online, and it feels like a door to a new world has been opened. You quickly realise, "Oh, I'm learning in a completely different way here." Learning a different kind of knowledge: one that is so contextual and so interdisciplinary, you're left thinking "I don't know where else I would find that, which isn't a melting pot of all of these different essences." You realise that each day whilst you're making progress on the one learning journey you came for, you're also progressing along 26 others in parallel, because of the information-rich learning environment, where you're constantly translating across multiple highly unique centres of inquiry. You're supported in this complexity by intuitive, digital tooling for collective intelligence, that beautifully presents data-informed stories of what is emerging from the group as a whole. The aim each individual supports is to not collapse the polarity of either purely experiential or objective, but to navigate with subtlety the third way: the poetic dance with the two. From the beginning, this aim has been action-oriented. Each node within this knowledge graphing ecosystem can become (on-chain) pledges of action within a p2p learning and resource sharing network. This level of granularity in learning objects is novel. When you go back, you say to others, "I've just met the most amazing people, and it's like nothing you've ever seen before." You're bringing with you a container of that infrastructure and data, on your own domain, so you can continue making progress after your transformational experience at the [[Astralship]]. 

You're proud to be a voyager, carrying the DNA of this experience with you into the future. Partly because of this diversity - this strongly branded quirkiness - it has been an experience that combined people in the arts and performative space, with proper nerdy science, within a robust information architecture. Because of the graph-orientated knowledge, the science publishing elements, and the way that you met people, you feel like not only did you just go to a theatre performance, you're now part of the future of this emerging peer-to-peer learning world in a way that's highly useful. You're onboarded into the graph-based, action-oriented learning commons. It's an advanced space: one where if you go to Cambridge or Princeton to talk about it, and spoke with someone who was a philosopher of knowledge, they'd go "Oh, really?" Not just that's a cool, quirky event you went to, but that it's interesting epistemically.
