Alternative name proposals: Villaging OS, Re-Imaging Earth

Obeya is the world environment situation room, involving data visualisation, network analysis, VR and bioregioning. The aim is to create a mixed-reality environmental cybernetics pedagogy, integrating all systems present in the process of villaging. The product of this exploration might aim to aid multi-disciplinary teams with making data-informed decisions in relation with complex contexts. Integrated food, energy and water systems.
