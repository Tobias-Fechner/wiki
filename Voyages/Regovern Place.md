#land-relations #collective-decision-making #governance #value #commoning #bioregioning

Governance, land, valuing, time: from ownership to stewardship; power over to power with. The Regovern Place voyage asks "What would make commons governance regenerative?" addressing both place-specific elements such as land and water, energy, education infrastructure, as well as virtual spaces and the agreements by which online commoning efforts govern themselves. The voyage will lift into focus leading practices and technologies of law, code and finance within the context of regenerative application, with a focus on bioregional land stewardship.
