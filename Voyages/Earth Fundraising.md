The Earth Fundraising voyages is about prototyping a new kind of fundraising, which crowdsources money, time, pledges, mutual credit, and crypto - all sorts. Building on the [[Regovern Place]] voyage, perhaps within a new legal ownership and governance structure. Its focus is on Earth themes. The aim is to involve all other organisations with .earth domains, all projects with a regenerative, and environmental quality, and together develop a fundraising structure to run each year on Earth Day. Could merge with the Prism voyage, in the sense that awarding fellowships could be seen as a funding-related endeavour. In that sense, the evaluation of place-based work becomes a central theme in this voyage also - the effects of the funding and/or fellowships.
