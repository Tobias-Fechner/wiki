The Exodus voyage is a science-fiction/ art voyage that wraps around the other voyages. It's extremely specific to refugees and story, relates to a Paul Hamlyn grant on access to arts, and tells a Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy -based story of wales: The Hitchikers Guide to Wales. It might have some fundraising, art, academy aspects. How can marginalised communities better access arts, learning, innovation? The voyage would aim to work with communities to visualise what a future of regenerative governance would look like on this planet, and for that to become an art piece: role-play, screen play, podcasting etc. The question of how to own and/or collectively manage this artwork is a question the [[Land]] voyage could contribute toward.
