The primary nature of our work in the world as Astralship is that of facilitating and holding **alignment**. We do so by supporting the self-organisation of voyage participants around *resonant lines of work*.

Resonant lines of work are activities undertaken individually or collectively which are mutually reinforcing, or synergistic. Each part benefits from the actions of other *parts*, as does the *whole*, and any *sub-wholes* therein.

As such, our work, that of **facilitating voyages**, is focused on *catalyse collaboration across networks* to form action-oriented inter-disciplinary teams, together developing:
1. Each contributors own aims, as well as...
2. A common aim greater than themselves (see [[Crewing]]).
 
In the below images, we demonstrate how our approach is informed by the principle and pattern of [autopoiesis.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11084-012-9297-y) We encourage each participant, regardless of the nature of their interaction, to find a [[Mandates|role]] within the making of their [[Dive Deeper/Onboarding (Graduating)/Envoices/Crew|crew]], their voyage, and the season as a whole.

## How does this work?

Through the in-house tooling and facilitation as part of our [[Astral Infrastructure]] we make dynamic network agreement formation possible and make visible all energetic flows. In this way, the [[Dive Deeper/Onboarding (Graduating)/Envoices/Crew|crew]] can focus on co-creation and leave the heavy lifting of weaving and synergizing work to us.

## Resonance Beyond the Ship

One of our underlying principles is to count on the [[Dive Deeper/Onboarding (Graduating)/Envoices/Crew|crew]] to co-create a successful voyage with us. To that end, we see crew engaging others from their network to help co-market the voyage, attracting other collaborators, stakeholders, and benefactors. In this way, the voyaging process is a platform on which to broadcast their work to a greater audience.

## Uncovering Synergies through the Voyaging Process

One perspective sees the needs of their own work, as well as the forces restraining its development. One project may need a community their work could be adopted by, another may need tools to further the aims of their community. One may be seeking funding, one may be looking for innovative community-centric projects to fund. Voyaging is the process by which to discover the connections present among these network intersections.

## Informing and being Informed across Scales

Beyond a single voyaging process, there is the season of voyaging as a whole. We call this [[Seasoning Value Creation|seasoning]] - finding a common thread across all voyages, and a contribution toward a common aim - a [[Provocation|provocation]] - greater than they could on their own.

## Onboarding into Fractal Networks 

By contributing toward a [[Voyaging Value Creation|voyaging]] process hosted by the [[Astralship]], participants are recognised as graduates from a unique learning-by-being experience. This recognition will later encode access-rights to the rest of our ecosystem and network - see [[Astral Alumni Passport]].
