Here we can begin to visualise the work. [[Astralship]] is using this technique to organise projects, voyages and people by accounting for the time people invest into helping grow this project. See [[How to Envoice]] once you're ready to put this into practice. 
# Energy Appreciation
Below is a first-draft for a basic underlying pattern that could be employed for each "envoice" - voice-based energy invoicing - to reflect contributions towards system needs.

# Energy Voicing
We look to create a better, simpler, and value-rich form of invoicing. We see to create a workflow and develop specific tools that enable invoicing through sending in asynchronous audio messages to a chat channel of your choice. 

Our first iteration of this is to create a way for people's time contributions to be accounted for by daily invoicing in the form of voice notes.

# Stake Sharing
This way we'll begin to register the contributions being made by each collaborator in a low-touch, high-resolution way.

# Dynamic Energy Mapping
In the process, creating the means to visualise the changing topology of network collaborations, and contributions toward the systems the crews are working on. We'll synthesise these audio uploads as an action-oriented podcast. One episode for each voyage. 

We've built the first step already! Our team practices invoicing their hours with voice notes and these hours are reflected in [[Dive Deeper/Onboarding (Graduating)/Envoices/Crew|Crew Envoices]].
