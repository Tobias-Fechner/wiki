# **Transparency and Shared Value**
Astralship Voyages operates on a foundation of transparency and shared value creation. For Core Crew members, a dynamic equity split will be established based on a "pie-slicing" model. This model considers factors such as pre-voyage project value, ongoing contributions (including facilitation, design, and energy accounting), and the success of products or ventures incubated during the Voyage. Additionally, fundraising efforts undertaken collaboratively will be factored into the final equity distribution. We believe this dynamic approach ensures a fair and rewarding experience for all Core Crew members, directly reflecting their investment and the value they co-create.

Crew core contribute by means of staking their prior work into the collaboration process and physically boarding the ship, helping nurture the collective flow. They are responsible for creating the field for this work to thrive within, as well contributing toward the means of viability: 
1. Voyaging sponsorship
2. Voyaging participants

Additional crew - developers, artists, designers, researchers, activists, and all kinds of practitioners - are required by the core crew to help bring the work into being. Their attendance may be subsidised by voyage sponsors, by their contributions to the ship, and/ or by the income generated by the educational content. Therefore, crew core are incentivised to commit to helping co-create the viability of voyages, helping raise much needed funds to reciprocate the value created by the crew. 

Voyage participants are those who attend the weekend intensives, or wish to have access to the online conferencing. They benefit from learning of the insights the innovation process produces, as well as networking with the luminaries that the voyage attracts.

With facilitation by incredibly capable practitioners, as well as our in-person collaboration environment, we aim to advance each core member's work in alignment with a common whole.

Our voyaging methodology and infrastructure aims to materialise the [[Voyage Products]] that ensure two capabilities vital to the continued development of these lines of work: 
1. POST- Each cohort can continue the collaboration beyond the end of voyaging at Astralship if they wish to; 
2. RE- Crew core are imbued with the means necessary to develop their own voyaging excursions.

# Incubating Consortiums around Multiple Lines of Work
Our aim is to incubate the organising relations necessary to initiate mini ecosystems of collectives actively resourcing one another to create themed [[Provocation|provocation]]s of [ancient and emerging](https://www.culturehack.io/issues/) paradigms. By contributing to the conditions necessary for this work to thrive (rent-free voyaging for crew core), we hope to multiply its depth and breadth to be able to sustain even the most ambitious systemic innovations. This is the value proposition we offer crew.

Heart-on over to [[Seasoning Value Creation]] to see how this could play out for seasons as a whole, with season crew resourcing multiple inter-related themes.
