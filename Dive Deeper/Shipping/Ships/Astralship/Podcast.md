There are many great conversations that happen at the ship. A very small subset of these make their way onto the Astralship podcast. So far, these have been long-form, intentionally initiated conversations that can be hosted by anyone at any point on anything. At the moment, Spotify is being used as an archive for these recordings. Once the quality (content and processing) is sufficient, the podcast will be officially launched.

# API
The choice of platform may change. The choice of platform should take into account audio accessibility. These audios and others contribute to the overall landscape of data that animates the collective intelligence platform. For this reason at least, the podcasting platform that is chosen should make available the data via an API.
# Branding Astralship
The podcast also serves an important role of bridging from the unique space that is the Astralship to the rest of the world.
