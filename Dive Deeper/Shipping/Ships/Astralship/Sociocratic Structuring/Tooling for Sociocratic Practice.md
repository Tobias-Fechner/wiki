## Writing
### Obsidian (public versions)
In the realm of writing and documentation, Obsidian serves as our primary platform for creating public versions of documents. Its robust linking and organizational capabilities allow us to craft coherent and interconnected narratives. We leverage Obsidian's markdown editor to articulate and refine ideas collaboratively, ensuring that our written content is both comprehensive and accessible. The platform's version control features enable easy tracking of document changes, fostering transparency and accountability in the writing process.

### Drive (for review and comment)
For collaborative review and commentary, Google Drive becomes a central hub. Documents drafted in Obsidian are often shared via Drive to facilitate feedback and input from team members. The commenting and suggestion features in Drive allow for detailed annotations, fostering a dynamic and iterative approach to writing. This collaborative dimension enhances the quality of our content, as diverse perspectives are considered and integrated during the review process.

### Asana (thoughts and notes)
While Asana is typically associated with task management, we leverage its capabilities for organizing thoughts and notes related to the writing process. Asana's flexibility allows us to create sections dedicated to brainstorming, outline development, and miscellaneous notes. This centralized approach ensures that relevant insights and considerations are seamlessly integrated into the broader writing workflow.

## Contracting
### Obsidian (signed agreements)
Obsidian plays a crucial role in the contracting phase, especially for signed agreements. We use Obsidian to draft, negotiate, and finalize contracts collaboratively. Its linking features help create a comprehensive network of interconnected documents, ensuring that all relevant details are captured. Obsidian's version control also provides a clear audit trail of changes, enhancing transparency and accountability in the contracting process.

### Circles (rituals)
Within the sociocratic framework, Circles serve as a ritualistic space for contracting. During Circle meetings, agreements and decisions are made with the consent of all members. This inclusive and consent-based approach ensures that each participant has a say in the terms of the contract. Circles provide a structured and ceremonial setting for negotiating and solidifying agreements, aligning with the principles of sociocracy.

## Actioning
### Asana (work plan and conversations)
Asana serves as our primary platform for action-oriented tasks. Work plans, task assignments, and project timelines are meticulously organized within Asana. The platform's task management features facilitate clear communication and coordination among team members. Additionally, Asana's comment section enables asynchronous conversations tied to specific tasks, ensuring that contextual discussions are seamlessly integrated into the workflow.

### Telegram (synchronous communications)
For synchronous communications during action-oriented tasks, Telegram becomes our go-to platform. The real-time nature of Telegram allows for quick decision-making and immediate responses. It serves as a space for brief and urgent communications, enabling team members to coordinate effectively and address time-sensitive matters. Telegram complements the asynchronous nature of Asana, providing a balanced communication ecosystem.

## Deciding
### Sociocratic Process Async (Drive)
Decisions within the sociocratic framework often involve asynchronous processes, and Google Drive becomes a key platform for this. Proposals, consent rounds, and decision documentation are shared on Drive, allowing team members to contribute their input at their own pace. This asynchronous approach promotes thoughtful consideration and ensures that decisions are made with the collective wisdom of the group.

### Sociocratic Process Live (Zoom)
For more immediate and live decision-making processes, Zoom serves as a virtual meeting space. Real-time video conferencing allows for dynamic discussions, clarifications, and consent rounds. Zoom meetings within the sociocratic process provide an interactive platform for resolving any uncertainties and finalizing decisions collaboratively, fostering a sense of shared ownership among participants.

## Resolving
### Calling In (Telegram)
In situations requiring [[Sociocracy and Conflict Resolution|conflict resolution]] or addressing sensitive matters, Telegram serves as a platform for "Calling In." This involves initiating private conversations to resolve conflicts collaboratively and respectfully. Telegram's immediate and direct messaging features provide a space for nuanced discussions, allowing team members to address challenges and find common ground.

### Healing (Circles)
Within the sociocratic framework, Circles also play a role in the healing process. When conflicts arise, Circles provide a structured and supportive environment for team members to express their concerns, share perspectives, and collectively seek resolution. This ritualistic approach to healing aligns with sociocracy's emphasis on maintaining healthy relationships within the organization.
