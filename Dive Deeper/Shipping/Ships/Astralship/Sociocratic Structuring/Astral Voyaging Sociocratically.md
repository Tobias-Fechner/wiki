Sociocracy is a methodology that enables organisations to use the wisdom of social relations in order to adapt easily and grow sustainably - like a living organism.

A ship is any organisation that a group of people forms to sustain a shared project with a distinct mission, vision and values.

A ship goes on a [[voyage]] to achieve a destination with a [[Captain|captain]] and [[Crewing|crew]]. Voyaging could include making grant applications, launching entrepreneurial ventures, publishing a media piece, and even personal projects such as finishing writing a book. 

An Astralship is a ship with a focused purpose to enable ships and voyages aligned with the vision of regenerative planet through facilitating resources, tools and methodologies to optimise probabilities of success across all parameters.   

In order to apply the Sociocratic method at the Astralship, we can understand five areas of knowledge/process restructuring that enable voyaging to be undertaken in a more agile, evolutionary and self-organizing manner while still retaining the clarity, cohesion and collective focus yielded by organising as a ship's crew.
