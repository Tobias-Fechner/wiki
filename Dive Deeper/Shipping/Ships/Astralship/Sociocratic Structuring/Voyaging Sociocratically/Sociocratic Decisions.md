# Decisions 
In the course of undertaking routine tasks onboard a voyage and of course as part of strategic processes, the emergence of tensions is natural. This might be due to competing priorities, lack of resources, miscommunication, or as is often the case - simply the fact that we are humans.

This is where the sociocratic process distinguishes itself from most other methodologies, and where it's hybridisation with the voyaging methodology comes most into its own. Whenever a tension emerges, a role-holder can either choose to discuss it, or make an immediate decision. 

If the tension is something that significantly affects the accountabilities of any other role-holder or that impacts the voyage mandate, it must be taken through the [[Consent Process]].

If it is something that is clearly within the mandate of the role-holder in question, a spontaneous decision must be taken.

If it is something that one is unsure about, they may either consult with the captain or request for help from another crew member or on the relevant public forum.

At any point during a collective decision-making process, the Captain can use their position of hierarchy to expedite and compel consent in order to prevent losses to the ship, the voyage or the crew. Similar powers can be exercised by other crew members for any collective decision that is clearly within their mandate. If this power is used, it must be reviewed at most within a month as part of the [[Role Review]] process.
