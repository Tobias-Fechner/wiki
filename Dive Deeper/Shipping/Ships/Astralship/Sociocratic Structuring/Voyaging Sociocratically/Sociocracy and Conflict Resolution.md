# Conflict Resolution
Often, decisions either don't get made, are suboptimal, or are unable to resolve more structural tensions. Or, again, it could just be because we are human. Either way, sometimes tensions don't get resolved and turn into conflicts. 

When they do, they must be resolved at the speed of trust that exists between the conflicting parties - to minimise the loss of momentum and direction. 

The resolution follows a simple, humane process of sharing and listening actively, and can be facilitated either by a mandated role onboard the crew (on the Phoenix, it is either the Wizard or the Cook), or by an external facilitator that is consented to by all parties and/or the Captain.

For any conflict that takes longer than 3 sessions to resolve, the captain or the crew at large has the power to **call its time** and use the decision-making process to address the root cause - which could necessitate an editing of the governance structuring in questioning, or a refreshing of the role-holders. 

In the absence of conflicts and tensions pertaining to other roles, any blockages in personal work or deviation from agreed expectations must be communicated ASAP to the team/coordinator so that adjustments can be made and work redistributed as needed
# Processes
## Noting
Whoever notices the need for a conflict resolution must note why it exists and between which roles. It is important to frame the conflict as being between the roles and not the people in those roles. Neither Sociocracy, nor a Voyaging Methodology can resolve personality differences and disputes. 

This noting is personal but can be registered with the role mandated to hold space for conflict resolution - which at the Phoenix is the Cook. 
## Raising
If the tension continues to exist or grow despite relevant decision-making processes continuing, it must be raised for the process to be initiated. Either the role-holder in question, the Cook or the Captain must register it with the Wizard (whose mandates includes facilitating the regular Crew circles.)
