# Working Group 
In addition to the [[DNAs|DNA]] - which constitutes **onboarding onto the ship**, the crew must also be **onboarded onto the specific voyage** being undertaken. A voyage, being not an entity but a project, can be understood as a specific project and has its own description the format of which varies from ship to ship. 

Based on this brief, a [[Mandates|mandate]] is generated to constitute a Voyage Working Group which the crew then undertakes collectively for the duration of the Voyage.

The mandate consists of the destination of the voyage (Purpose), the areas of work to be undertaken (Accountabilities) and outcomes to be achieved/maintained (Domains). 

The ship might have other working groups to sustain its broader functioning or it might only exist for the purpose of undertaking voyages. It might have pre-existing working groups that  could be applicable to the specific voyage, or the captain and crew of the specific voyage decide upon further working groups that are relevant to achieve the voyage goals.

You can look at the 2024 voyaging mandates for [[Astralship]], Phoenix, [[Engedi]] to understand better.
# Working Group Circling
- Everyone has deliverables which are recorded and reported on during a weekly all-roles call
- Before this meeting, anything that requires collective decision-making is brought up at least 24 hours in advance and put into the agenda with any relevant information
- During meeting proposals are briefly explained (if not already shared) and a Consent-based decision-making is followed to arrive at decision, which is recorded in minutes and changes are made to any relevant official documents
- Beyond the decisions, all other agenda points are given action points (ideally with deadlines) and people in charge, and these action points are then brought up in the next meeting for review/progress
