# Work 
Work is the essence of a crew on a voyage. Not only will the destination be missed out on if the work done is improper, but there is danger of the ship sinking or [[Sociocracy and Conflict Resolution|conflicts]] breaking out in the absence of sufficient alignment within the work.

Therefore, in order to ensure that anyone onboarded onto a crew has little opportunity to be distracted or led astray by shiny objects or personal interests, the [[DNAs|DNA]] of the entity must be made crystal clear. The DNA, like in a given cell, is what enables work to be produced that keeps the organism alive and able to grow.

The DNA of a crew is set by the ship which is hosting or commissioning a crew and/or a voyage, and can be approximated by the stated Mission, Vision and Values. You can learn more about the Astralship, Phoenix and Engedi ship's DNAs here.
