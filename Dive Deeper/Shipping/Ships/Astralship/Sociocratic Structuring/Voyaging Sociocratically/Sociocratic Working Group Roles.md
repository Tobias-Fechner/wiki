Once the crew is clear about the broader work (Ship DNA) and the specifics of the voyage they are going on (Working Group Mandate), each member must take up a clearly defined and scoped role. A role is at the second level of delegation where it upholds ownership of part of the Purpose, Accountabilities and Domains of the broader working group.

In a given voyage, there might be a wide variety of roles that are decided upon and undertaken. Onboard the Phoenix, these are the roles: 
1. Captain
2. [[Astral Cook|Cook]]
3. [[Astral Navigator|Navigator]]
4. [[Astral Engineer|Engineer]]
5. Wizard

Each role-holder is primarily responsible for ensuring that the accountabilities contained in the mandate are regularly fulfilled - whether that is undertaking tasks, contributing to/making decisions or communicating information and updates.
