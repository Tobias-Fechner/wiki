# Description
Ecosystem Restoration Camps is a global movement focused on restoring damaged ecosystems. Camps are established in various locations, bringing together volunteers to work on ecological restoration projects.
# Use of Sociocracy
Some of the camps have implemented sociocracy to enhance collaboration and decision-making among participants. Sociocracy's adaptability and emphasis on inclusivity align well with the decentralized and community-driven nature of ecosystem restoration efforts.
