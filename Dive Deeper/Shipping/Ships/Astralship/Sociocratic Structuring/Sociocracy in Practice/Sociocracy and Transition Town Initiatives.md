# Description
Transition Town initiatives are community-led movements that seek to build local resilience and reduce environmental impact in response to global challenges such as climate change and resource depletion.   
# Use of Sociocracy
Some Transition Town initiatives have adopted sociocracy to facilitate collective decision-making and effective governance. The model supports the decentralized nature of these initiatives, allowing for local autonomy while maintaining a networked structure for collaboration.
