# Description
Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are community-led organizations that focus on acquiring and stewarding land for the benefit of the community. 
# Use of Sociocracy
Some CLTs have embraced sociocracy to distribute decision-making power and ensure that community members have a voice in land-use planning, development, and management. This approach helps build a sense of ownership and shared responsibility within the community.
