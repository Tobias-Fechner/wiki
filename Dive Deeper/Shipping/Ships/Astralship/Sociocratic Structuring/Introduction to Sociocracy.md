# Why Sociocracy 
At the Astralship, we use the Voyaging Methodology to host intensive group experiences which incubate and launch impactful projects for the transition towards a regenerative civilization. While we offer the Sociocratic Framework as a **suggestion** for governing [[Sociocratic Decisions|decision-making]] during the course of [[Voyage|voyaging]], we primarily use it internally for the governance of the Astralship as organisms operating in the economic, social, political, cultural and ecological spheres of society.

We've begun to detail how we use the sociocratic framework in [[Sociocracy and Astralship]]. 
# Sociocracy
Sociocracy is a tool that has been used by communities around the world to self-organize for a variety of causes. It draws upon social and biologically evolutionary principles, allowing any given group of people to act as a singular organism operating in uncertain environments. 

Developed by Gerard Endenburg in the 1970s, sociocracy represents a paradigm shift in organizational structures. Rooted in principles of equality, transparency, and adaptability, sociocracy aims to create harmonious and effective group dynamics. This system, often referred to as dynamic governance, draws inspiration from cybernetics and is built upon a foundation of consent-based decision-making, circle structures, and a scientific understanding of systems and human behavior. As organizations increasingly seek innovative approaches to address the complexities of the modern world, sociocracy emerges as a compelling framework that not only empowers individuals within the organization but also enhances the group's overall [[Sociocracy and Adaptability|adaptability]].
# Examples
