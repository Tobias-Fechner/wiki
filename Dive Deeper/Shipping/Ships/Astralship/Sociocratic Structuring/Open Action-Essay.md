**This is an open, rough draft of an action-essay.**

Sociocracy is a #toolkit for #decision-making that relies upon consent to enhance #adaptability of #organisations.

Consent is key. 

For those of you who have been fortunate enough to receive proper sexual education, this phrase won't be unfamiliar.

However, I am certain that you've rarely, if ever, thought about professional relationships through the lens of consent. Once you do, you realize how absolutely pervasive and essential the concept is to **every** area of life, and definitely, Voyaging. 

Scoping out for a second to the meta-goal of the Astralship - *to catalyse collective flow in service to planetary regeneration* - it becomes evident how lack of **informed** consent is at the root of ecosystems destruction, perpetual injustice, violation of basic rights and so on. 

If one extrapolates that inquiry to ecosystems as living, even *sentient* entities (sentientities?) themselves, humanity's collective task of the moment becomes quite straightforward - we need to ask bioregions and ecosystems if our proposed project is okay with it. How one does it? That's for another time. 

For now, let us now scale back down to the context of the Astralship and it's wonderous voyaging potential. What are the entities under consideration here whose consent must be solicited in *any* decision-making instance (not necessarily *every*)?

1. Captain: Holds primary responsibility for all decisions-made onboard voyage.
2. Crew: Hold primary responsibility for area of voyage operations decision-making. 
3. Voyagers: Take responsibility for achievement of some or all voyage goals.
4. Sailors/Volunteers: Take responsibility for fulfilling certain set of regular tasks during voyage.
5. Miscellaneous Supporters: Responsible for supplying financial, intellectual, social and other resources to sustain, evolve and expand voyage activities.

The above five categories are quite straightforward. The phrasing in terms of responsibility alludes to the consent reached between the role-holder and the larger, collective organism to work for mutual benefit. Let us consider the former below.    

Each individual associated with a voyage must accept a primary [mandate] under one of the above. There exist [template mandates] for roles within each category which are a part of the [Astralship Architecture]. Upon signing up for a voyage, said individual engages in a modification process to align the template role with their expectations and a three-way consent between the individual, their [Circle Coordinator] and the Captain is reached. 

The Circle Coordinator and/or the Captain in this case are acting primarily as representatives of the collective organism. The organism therein is also engaging in this act of consent-giving. This act evolves as the complexity of the organism increases, but in true permacultural fashion, the nature of the act itself remains relatively simple and straightforward.

So, beyond the above five categories of entities involved in decision-making or consent-giving, we also have the 6th entity - the collective/organism/circle. There are *n levels* of organisation possible within this category. For example, we could have:

1. Astralship Fleet: Has ownership of maintaining overarching strategic mission & vision 
2. Astralship Phoenix: Has ownership of sustainability and growth for specific Astralship.
3. Specific Voyage: Has ownership of reaching clearly defined destination and treasury.
4. Voyage Departments: Has ownership of ensuring vitality of specific areas of work.
5. Voyage Sub-Deparments: Ownership of further specialisation, and so on...

Each of the above will also have a primary #mandate that restricts the scope of their contribution to decision-making and/or requirement of participation in consent processes. 

So far, we have two areas of entities whose consent will be required to make decisions and move ahead with the activities of an Astralship Voyage. The entities will be identifiable by the mandate that they take on and will be represented by individuals who accept the relevant mandates.

These entities will then participate in #Sociocratic decision-making processes as the need emerges. There is a high level of trust required among the individuals to ensure that the right entities are called upon in consideration of the right decisions. This trust can and must be prioritized over and above all other aspects of collective functioning. In my experience, the following tactics help foster greater trust.

1. Core DNA: A set of values that are inalienable to every action undertaken as part of the voyage and which can be used as the cornerstones of any [[Sociocracy and Conflict Resolution|conflict]] or ambiguity addressing process.
2. Strategic Goals: Succinct and categorically described meta-outcomes that are the duty of every affiliated individual to embody the pursuit of throughout their tenure onboard the #voyage. 
3. Human-Human Time: Dedicated spaces where individuals intentionally step out of their roles and connect with each other authentically - under stressful, playful and camaraderic settings.

So far we have the following components of the consent-based sociocratic process as applicable to Voyaging onboard the Astralship:

1. Entities
	1. Individual
	2. Collective
2. Mandates
3. Decision-Making Instances
4. Trust
	1. DNA
	2. Strategy
	3. Friendship

If all of the above are working well, there is little need for anything else. Let us take the example of Shikhar to understand how this works in practice.

Shikhar is member of the Astralship Core Crew. This is #collective-entity which has the mandate to scale up and out the mission of establishing Astralships around the world.

To honour this mandate, Shikhar takes up the role of a [Cook] for the [Knowledge Management Voyage] which has the primary purpose of ensuring vitality of crew members for the voyage.

The following case describes how the Sociocratic process plays out for Shikhar as the #Cook.

1. On the third day of a two week Voyage, the Cook realizes that two cliques are forming among the voyagers. He is concerned as in-group/out-group dynamics are known to sabotage collective flow. 

2. But in order to take any action, he must act on behalf of an entity that is concerned with this situation. He checks his mandate as a Cook, as well as his mandate as a Core Crew member. Under the cook mandate, he finds the following #accountability:

		"To act as the first point of triage for conflict"

3. He understands that this is not a conflict yet, so he cannot do anything about it apart from keep an eye out for further signs. This is the first step of the Sociocratic process, respecting the foundational layer of consent that all entities have given for individuals to represent their interests. However, Shikhar, the human, knows that he needs to do something. So he checks both his relevant mandates again.
As a cook, he holds the following accountability:
		"To plan and oversee execution of group events to enhance collective mood"
As an Astralship Core Crew member, he has:
		"To continually evolve the Voyaging Methodology through suggesting improvements"

4. He decides that given the lack of urgency about the situation, he will ensure his primary accountabilities are executed first, and then if he has remaining time, he will:
	1. Bring this up to the other Voyage Crew members in the next Check-in Circle and if needed, present a proposal to organise a social event designed to foster inter-clique connections
	2. Make notes about how aspects of the cliquing play out in converstaions and interactions, what impact they have on productivity/morale, and how it changes post the social.

In the above story, we have covered the two entities that Shikhar represents, how his mandate(s) define the possibilities of his actions, the instances in which he had to make personal and collective decisions, and the varying levels of trust between the Ship/Phoenix Crew and the Voyager Crew.

It is possible that the cliquing was a result of lack of sufficient integration into the DNA or Goals of the Voyage which left people to resort to personality affinities to define their social interactions. It also possible that given the wide range of people, the cliquing would actually be helpful in reaching the Voyage destination as it allowed individuals to be more comfortable inhabiting their chosen roles. Shikhar chose to leave this decision to the collective intelligence of the Phoenix Crew.

As Astralship's Collective Intelligence capabilities evolve, other layers of collective intelligence or touch-points thereof might emerge that minimise the time taken for such decisions to be taken. For example:

- Messaging Commands: If during a voyage the /need commands are being left unresolved or the /decide command is being used too much, it could indicate absence of trust or overwhelm of information which could help decide whether said cliquing is useful or harmful.
- Warm Data Boards: If the mood triangles start showing frictional clustering or chaotic patterns, it could indicate that something is off. 

So far, we have discussed how:
- Sociocracy is a decision-making process that relies on consent.
- Consent is given by the operational entities of a collective organism/project.
- These entities are represented by individuals who taken on mandates
- Mandates define the extent to which an entity is concerned with decision-making - they are the foundational layer of consent, and are offered by the project source. 
- Individuals execute decisions that are clearly stipulated in their mandates without consultation - unless under extenuating circumstances. 
- If unclear or faced with a decision that has a clear impact on other mandates, the role-holder brings up the matter in a regular or spontaneously scheduled #circle to get advice from other entities.
- A proposal is made for a certain plan of action and if consented to by all, the decision is taken ahead by all relevant role-holders. **This is the second layer of consent.**
- This layer could also be enacted asynchronously though text or voice-based processes.
- There is a possibility of an additional intervening layer that might allow group or unclear decisions to be taken through necessary data being made available that minimises the need for group consent - although this requires the level of trust among role-holders to be very high.

As the organism grows and evolves, other aspects and layers of consent come into play. 

For starters, the most critical aspect of this process that most organisms find difficult to implement is the **maintenance of #feedback-loops** for every decision undertaken. The key factors for feedbacking are logging (measurement), following up (time) and integration (evolution).

In the above instance, ideally, there would be feedback loops for each of:
- Decision to bring matter to larger circle - must be logged under the Cook's accountability of maintaining ship morale and followed up on in a week, and at the end of Voyage. It should then be parsed as part of the [[Harvest Process]] and integrated into [[Basic Methodology]] as needed.
- Decision to organise a #voyager-social - must be logged as part of Voyage goals to foster collective identity and measured via a before/after observation process. It should similarly be harvested and integrated as part of larger process.

Another possibility is the emergence of other consenting entities. Also knowable as the sub-division of circles. For example, after repetitively noticing the need for social bridging and morale boosting to be done across 3 consecutive voyages, the Cook proposes that a new role be created under the Cook's mandate called the Friend whose main job is maintain camaraderie and an air of mutual support among all voyagers. This role will then be given a specific subset of the Cook's mandate, expanded into detail, and will be akin to a new specialised organ that has evolved for the Astralship's enhanced functioning.

The above two are experiences I have had. Something else that might emerge in our work is a tertiary layer of consent that is disembodied - that is, not bound to a named entity, but gradually coming to be expressed by certain spaces, resources or processes. Let us consider each of these:

- Spaces: The kitchen table might come to become a space which doesn't allow for arguments. Without being enforced in any direct way, over months of being the gathering point for warm, collective vibes - it starts to become a part of decision-making and any discussions had over the kitchen table will either tend to skew towards cohesion or be reminded of the need for shared warmth. 
- Resources: Money could gradually be imbued with particular decision-making powers. For example, as part of the Grocery Shopping process, it is understood that essential foods are not to be skimped on. As such, when making decisions about what to buy for a voyage week, in addition to the cook performing their role of making the shopping list (foundational consent) and voyagers proposing certain items based on what they'd like to cook (secondary layer), money brings the tertiary layer of essentials vs non-essentials as defined for that particular voyage.
- Processes: The process of cooking itself could become a consenting actor in a decision-making instance, such as that of plan for the weekend during a voyage. Over time, it might become evident that weekend cooking is the responsibility of those who have energy left over after the week's activities and as such, the decision of when and what nourishment on a tired Sunday might entail the cooking process not being followed (with its consent, given its intelligence).

There are some areas yet to be covered, especially those around what happens when a decision taken by a role-holder ends up negatively impacting another entity, or when there is an impasse in a consent-based decision-making round, but there are sufficient manuals out there from which we can plug and play certain processes.

For now, this should suffice to begin work on designing the basic materials which would enable a Sociocratic flow premised on consent as the default decision-making mechanism for all Astralship Voyaging, iterated and evolved to the extent that decision-making becomes as easy as drinking water and a majority of time is spent enacting decisions in collective flow.
