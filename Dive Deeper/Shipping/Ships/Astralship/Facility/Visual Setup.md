1. Components
a. 4 LED Par Lights
b. DMX Controller + Lighting Cord
c. 4 3-Pin DMX Cables
2. How Power is Distributed
a. The DMX Console has its own power cable
b. Every LED Par light has an integrated power cable
c. Everything needs to be plugged in before starting
d. !!! It is important to plug in everything before turning the console on !!!
This step prevents electrical surges and protects the equipment over time.
3. How Signal is Distributed
a. The first DMX Cable comes out of the console on the back (F) and connects to
the first light on the DMX IN port (M).
b. To connect more lights, plug a cable from the DMX OUT port on the first light to
the DMX IN port on the second light.
c. For convenience, all lights are set to DMX channel #001
To set the channel: click the light’s menu button until you see “d ###”, use
up and down button to select “d 001” and then press enter.
4. Operating The Console
a. Once everything has been plugged in, the DMX Console can be turned on.
The power switch is on the back.
b. Since our lights are configured to Channel DMX 001, this means they can be
controlled on Channel #1 in Scanners.
Press #1 on the Scanner section to select a group of lights to control (In
this case #1).
c. The Sliders underneath “Scenes” are configured to control different aspects of
the lights.
#1: Brightness
#2: Red
#3: Green
#4: Blue
#5: Light sequence
#7: Strobing
d. To manually control light settings press the auto button on the side.
