Shipping within the Astralship methodology encompasses both the dynamic process of bringing regenerative projects to life and the creation of organizational structures that act as vessels to carry out these endeavors. Think of it as the multi-faceted journey from initial concepts to the establishment of dedicated entities with a shared mission, vision, and values.

**Key Stages of Shipping**

- **Ideation to Action:** Transforming concepts into concrete action plans, outlining the steps required for implementation.
- **Prototyping and Iteration:** Experimenting, testing, and refining ideas through rapid feedback cycles.
- **Resourcing:** Securing the funding, materials, and human capital necessary to fuel the project's journey.
- **Execution:** Putting plans into motion, managing timelines and overcoming challenges along the way.
- **Evaluation and Impact:** Measuring the outcomes of your project, understanding what worked and learning from what didn't.
- **Ship Formation:** For projects that gain momentum and demonstrate lasting impact, establishing a dedicated organizational structure (a "ship") becomes essential. This includes:
    - **Collective Identity:** Forging a shared purpose and values.
    - **Governance:** Choosing the structures that best reflect the needs and principles of the project.
    - **Legal Foundation:** Selecting the appropriate legal form for the ship's operations.

**Why Shipping Matters**

Shipping is the bridge between the potential of great ideas and the transformative power of their realization. Here's why it's crucial within the Astralship community:

- **Impact Focus:** We prioritize projects that deliver tangible benefits for people and the planet.
- **Learning Culture:** Shipping embraces an iterative approach where failures are seen as stepping stones to improvement.
- **Regenerative Outcomes:** Shipping ensures that our work aligns with principles of regeneration, positively contributing to the health of ecosystems and communities alike.
- **Long-Term Sustainability:** Establishing ships provides the infrastructure for enduring impact, allowing projects to scale and outlive individual contributions.

**Ships Born from Successful Seasons**

Successful voyage seasons often give birth to ships as the ideal vehicles to carry the outcomes, learnings, and network connections forward. These ships embark on new voyages, continuously evolving in alignment with the Astralship's regenerative mission.
