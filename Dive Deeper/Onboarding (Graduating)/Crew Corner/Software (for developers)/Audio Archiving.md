The following options have been reviewed with regard to archiving audio files:
1. Spotify - no programmatic upload
2. Dropbox - 2GB free, with existing Make module
3. Box - 10GB free, with existing Make module 
4. Mega - 20GB free, no existing Make module
5. Obsidian is a no-go: although you can [embed audios](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Audio+recorder), you're [limited to 4GB](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Hosting+media+files) of media files. 
# Dropbox
Suggest we start with Dropbox despite its smaller free storage allowance. This is becase it is better know to participants and the API has integrations to more libraries including the Livecode environment that David uses.

Additionally the free storage allowance should not be a limiting factor, as rather we need to address this with commons based storage solutions that should allow us practically unlimited free storage. We envisage integrating many free tiers, but in particular [[Archive.org]] and [[Wikimedia Commons]].

# Box
Box is the service of choice for [[Voice Notes]], where it has a significant free-tier storage allowance, and a [[Make]] module already exists. Mega would be preferred with double the storage allowance but is avoided for the hassle of making your own Make module.

# Spotify
Spotify is a good choice for longer-format audio files, such as 3hr recordings for [[Podcast]] episodes. The file upload process is done through the UI, with no API available (at time of writing). Therefore, Spotify is not suitable for archiving voice notes.
