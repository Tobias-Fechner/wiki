Using the faas-cli to create a new function using a given template, it's important to note that there are less issues using a python3-http-debian template, as opposed to a python3-http template, as the latter is based on an Alpine Linux base image which causes issue when installing whisper dependencies. Most notably, [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). As is described in the OpenFaas [docs](https://docs.openfaas.com/languages/python/), the python3-http template is for pure Python only, and the python3-http-debian template is required for native C modules, such as Pandas.
