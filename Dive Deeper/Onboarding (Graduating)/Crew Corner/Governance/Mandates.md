# Introduction 
Each social organism's existence within a [[Introduction to Sociocracy|sociocratic structure]] is defined by the purpose, accountabilities and domains written in its mandate. 

- **Purpose**: the simplest and most accurate description of the entities function
- **Accountabilities**: 3 - 5 verbs describing specific, regular (at least monthly) activities
- **Domains**: Specific pieces of work/outcomes that the role is the owner of 

Building on the ship metaphor, the following mandate templates have been made, translating from the fields of cybernetics and sociocracy: 

1. [[Captain]]
2. [[Cook]]
3. [[Navigator]]
4. [[Wizard]]
5. [[Engineer]]
# Mandating
- One line purpose of the role in the organism
- Clearly articulated list of accountabilities for each area of work whether its individual (role) or a group (circle)
- Tangible areas of primary [[Sociocratic Decisions|decision-making]] (domain)
