There are four main tools used by the crew on a daily basis: 
1. [[Asana]]
2. [[Obsidian]]
3. [[Fed Wiki]]
4. [[Telegram]]

Each is a data source of the crew's knowledge-making. Asana, Obsidian and Fed Wiki are used to document any aspect of Astralship.

The aim is to build [[microservices]] that can integrate these various data sources into one whole. That way, pages can be written into Asana, Obsidian or Fed Wiki, and audio notes could be sent into Telegram, and they all show up on the overall knowledge base. 

The primary microservice integrations are listed below. These are
1. [[Syncing]] 
	1. Obsidian 
	2. Fed Wiki
	3. Asana
2. Audio
	1. [[Telegram Audio Bot]]
