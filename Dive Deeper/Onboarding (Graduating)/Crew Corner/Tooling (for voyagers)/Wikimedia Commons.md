As part of the [[Anarchive]] we will be focussing on producing a commons of cultural significance. This work will be compatible with Wikipedia and other [[Free Culture]] archives. You can see from the description of permisable content that can be hosted is very broad and should effectively apply to virtually all regenerative content we create for [[Astralship]] voyaging. This may be surprising, but it is for good reason - our purposes are aligned.

# Automatic Uploading via API
Establishing the right editorial process to work constructively with Wikipedia and Wiki media Commons should allow us to leverage the api, and create automations for archiving and embedding of free culture content in our work and the [[Voyage]]s we harbour.

# Is it suitable for the commons?

1. Naturally, the media content should be of educational benefit.
2. Make sure it is in an open format (images, sound and video clips).
3. Is it likely to be useful to a [Wikimedia Foundation](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/ "foundation:") project? For example, can you point to a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ "w:") article that would benefit from this file's inclusion?

The expression "educational benefit" is to be understood according to its broad meaning of "_providing knowledge; instructional or informative_".

If you can't answer YES to these questions, maybe your file does not belong on the commons. [Commons:Project scope](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Project_scope "Commons:Project scope") contains more details about what is suitable to be included here.
# Evidence
In all cases the uploader must provide appropriate evidence to demonstrate either that the file is in the public domain or that the copyright owner has released it under a suitable licence. Typically that requires at least that the source of the file be specified,[1](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Project_scope#cite_note-1) along with the original source where the file is a [derivative work](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Derivative_works "Commons:Derivative works"). Also, the creator or copyright owner should be identified, if known or reasonably ascertainable. If there is any question, evidence may need to be supplied that the copyright owner has indeed released the file under the given licence.

Where the file is a photograph which shows an identifiable person, the subject's consent may be required as described at [Commons:Photographs of identifiable people](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Photographs_of_identifiable_people "Commons:Photographs of identifiable people").

In all cases, the burden of proof lies on the uploader or other person arguing for the file to be retained to demonstrate that as far as can reasonably be determined:

- the file is in the public domain or is properly licensed, and
- that any required consent has been obtained.

In the case of an old file, date and country of publication can help determine if the file is in the public domain due to age.
## Notes
1. Note that in the case of files found on the Web, this should not be the URL of the file, but the URL of the page containing the file, so that Commons editors can find background information when required.
