# Etymology
The word "gwerthfawrogiad" is a compound word in Welsh, composed of two main elements: "gwerth" and "mawrogiad."

1. Gwerth: The root "gwerth" means "value" or "worth" in Welsh. It comes from the Proto-Celtic word *wertos, which has cognates in other Celtic languages, such as Irish "luach" and Breton "werzh." Over time, "gwerth" has retained its meaning of "value" in Welsh.

2. Mawrogiad: The second element, "mawrogiad," is derived from "mawr," meaning "big" or "great." It is linked to the Proto-Celtic word *magos, which has connections to words in other Celtic languages, like Irish "m√≥r" and Breton "meur." In Welsh, "mawr" has evolved to represent size, importance, or significance.

The combination of "gwerth" and "mawr" in "gwerthfawrogiad" creates a compound word that encapsulates the idea of "appreciation" or "evaluation" of something of value or significance.

As with many languages, Welsh has evolved over centuries, and compound words like "gwerthfawrogiad" have likely developed gradually through usage and cultural context, showing the language's rich history and ability to adapt and grow over time.
