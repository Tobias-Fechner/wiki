# Tags
Proactive tag naming, like chatbot commands, can support the weaving of desired principles within the ship and team operations, such as:
1. Cultivating and practicing a living systems perspective
2. Employing inspiring metaphors: ship, pirate, crew, voyage
3. Wellbeing, care, playfulness

Verbs are preferred to nouns for the following reasons: 
1. The Astralship and all its voyages are living processes, with adaptive thinking.
2. Nouns are objectifying, verbs are animating. 
3. Nouns are mechanistic, verbs are systemic. 
4. Nouns are static, verbs are a process.

The tags reflect the [[Astralship Core Processes]] that lift into focus the voyaging metaphor as a living process.
