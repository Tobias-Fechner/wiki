Astral Alumni are the graduates of our [[Voyage|voyaging]] process, finding a non-local home among a network of fellow voyagers. Alumni may have voyaged for a single voyage, several or a whole season, contributions recognised. 

The process of graduating is synonymous with contributing to the voyaging. Unlike orthodox education institutions, the process of graduating begins the same time the process of voyaging does. Degree denotes not degree of correctness, but degree of contribution.

Graduating a [[Season|season]], therefore, requires contributing to the making of the season. We account for these contributions with our bespoke [[Envoice|"envoicing"]] pipeline - daily voice notes becoming invoices.
