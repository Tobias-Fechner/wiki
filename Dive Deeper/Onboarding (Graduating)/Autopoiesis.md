The triad proposed by Fritjof Capra, [^1] which underpins autopoiesis, consists of three interrelated elements:

1. **Process:** Refers to the dynamic activities or behaviors within a system. It encompasses the ongoing interactions and transformations that occur within the system.
    
2. **Structure:** Represents the physical components or entities that make up the system. This includes the various parts or elements and their spatial arrangement.
    
3. **Organization:** Refers to the pattern or arrangement of these components and their organizing relations within the system. It encompasses the dynamic network of interactions that maintain the system's structure and enable its self-regulation and self-maintenance.
