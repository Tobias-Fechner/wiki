Voyaging begins with place. We are committed to serving real needs among local networks of real relations.

Place also helps enrich the definition of progress made during the voyages, such as by centring participatory design processes with local initiatives, local user groups to prototype with, and perhaps even community-led land acquisitions (see [[Regovern Place]]).

The purpose of voyaging in a place-sourced way is to align, in symbiotic relationship, the life-giving methodologies and narratives explored in the voyages with local networks and initiatives.

# Welsh Activism Context
At the national level, Wales has a long history of decolonial resistance against England. Efforts to reclaim sovereignty continue to succeed presently, such as the establishment of the Welsh Assembly in 1999 (renamed the Welsh Parliament in 2020), and the establishment of Welsh as an official language of Wales in 2011 (after centuries of intense marginalisation in favour of English by the English legislative powers). Further efforts include: the creation of the new Curriculum for Wales in 2022 which emphasizes Welsh identity and language; several cultural events that celebrate Welsh heritage and identity - most notably Eisteddfod; and the ongoing effort of many community-based initiatives to grow food, regain autonomy, and protect traditional knowledge. 
# Voyage Synergies
With the voyages, we aim to embolden these efforts whilst also contributing to advancing the discourse in non-local fields of systems-change work. 
## Re:place Academy
The first voyage, [[Re-place Academy]], developing knowledge #commoning and peer-to-peer learning, focusses on place-sourced meaning-making - a learning environment that is sourced by the local contexts: language, lore and land. Below is an excerpt of a conversation that highlights the connection between this voyage theme and the local context.

> "The quarries were opened when slavery was made illegal by those who owned sugar plantations (Englishmen). The conditions for quarrymen were terrible. One of the longest strikes happened in Bethesda that lasted for 3 years. People were starving and eventually some decided to go back to work. That created a divide in the town - between those that chose to go back and those that didn't - that you can still sense today. The University of Bangor was actually set up by the quarry workers, who decided they'd had enough of those conditions, pooled together their pennies to make a fund and created their own access to higher education. The quarries were operational until the 60's when they became no longer profitable. " ~ Tom

## Regovern Place
The [[Regovern Place]] voyage aims to support a local farm in staking land into a community land trust. 
## Exodus
[[Exodus]], the storytelling voyage, seeks to initiate a distributed, inclusive podcast telling the story of place from the perspective of locals, aligning with Wales' declaration of its ambition to become the world's first sanctuary nation. 
## Obeya
[[Villaging OS]], the complex contexts and data voyage, centres on the second site in [[Caernarfon]] as a centre from which to explore the development of bioregional digital twinning. This voyage in particular is supported by being part of a network of 6 other digital twinning sites in Scotland, Iceland, the US, and Colombia, through our collaboration with [COBALT](https://cobaltlearningjourney.com/). 
## Earth Fundraising
Finally, we are in close collaboration with a very successful worker cooperative farm in the region, [[Tyddyn Teg]]. Besides providing hungry dwellers of our co-living site with a weekly box of delicious vegetables, they also recently raised Â£125k in a community shares offering and will be issuing more shares again the future. We are excited to engage with them around novel fundraising models in the [[Earth]] voyage.
