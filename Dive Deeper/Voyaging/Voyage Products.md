The purpose of the voyages is to facilitate the self-discovery and incubation of inter-disciplinary teams working on resonant areas of systems-change. The process by which we do this is our voyaging methodology, outlined in [[Astralship Core Patterns]], complemented by our [[Astral Infrastructure]]. 

Voyaging is a task that seeks to materialise several products. The core products common to each voyage are:
1. [[Voyage Site]]
2. [[Network agreements]]
3. [[Astral Alumni Passport]]
4. [[Voyage-unique Aims]]

These products should, respectively, give voyagers a way to: 
1. Engage others with what emerged during the voyage
2. Account for their contributions, be credited, and form network partnerships
3. Verify their enrolment and completion of the process, gaining access to the alumni network
4. Have materialised the aims unique to their voyage

In time, we'd like to show a dynamic, interactive, multi-dimensional story of the voyage, as gestured toward in [[Energy Accounting#Dynamic Energy Mapping]].

**Voyage Products:**
*Question:* What role do Voyage Products play in the broader context of Astralship voyages, and how do they contribute to the overall mission of regenerative innovation?

**Voyage Products:**

In the tapestry of Astralship voyages, the concept of "Voyage Products" emerges as the tangible and intangible artifacts crafted through collaborative endeavors during the voyage. These products, much like the unique treasures brought back from a distant exploration, hold significance not only for the specific voyage but also for the overarching mission of regenerative innovation.

At its core, a Voyage Product is more than a mere outcomeâ€”it encapsulates the essence of the voyage, embodying the collective efforts, insights, and creativity of the Voyage Crew. These products can take various forms, ranging from physical prototypes, digital solutions, artistic creations, to innovative frameworks and methodologies. The diversity of Voyage Products reflects the multidimensional nature of Astralship voyages, where exploration extends beyond traditional boundaries.

The creation of Voyage Products is intricately connected to the purpose and mandate of the voyage. The voyage's mission sets the stage for the crew to channel their energy and expertise into projects that align with the broader vision of regenerative planet-building. The products, therefore, become vessels of regenerative innovation, carrying within them the potential to catalyze positive change and contribute to sustainable practices.

One distinctive feature of Voyage Products is their evolutionary nature. The collaborative process of ideation, iteration, and refinement that takes place within the Voyage Crew infuses a sense of adaptability and responsiveness into the products. This adaptability is crucial, especially in the context of regenerative innovation, where solutions must evolve to meet the dynamic challenges of the environment.

Furthermore, Voyage Products are not confined to a static existence; they have a life beyond the voyage. Once crafted, these products become part of the Astralship's legacy, contributing to the cumulative knowledge and resources of the community. They are shared assets that hold the potential to inspire future voyages, acting as beacons of insight and experience for subsequent crews.

The impact of Voyage Products extends beyond the immediate Astralship community. They serve as tangible representations of the regenerative ethos, capable of influencing and inspiring external entities, partners, and stakeholders. Whether it's a sustainable technology, an innovative business model, or a creative expression, these products radiate the spirit of regenerative innovation, fostering a broader ecosystem of positive change.

The life cycle of Voyage Products involves a continual feedback loop. As they are introduced into the wider world, they invite reflections, learnings, and adaptations. This feedback loop contributes to the ongoing evolution of both the products and the methodologies employed by Astralship voyages, ensuring a continuous cycle of improvement and innovation.

In essence, Voyage Products are the artifacts of regenerative exploration, encapsulating the spirit of collaborative creation and innovation inherent in Astralship voyages. They are the tangible manifestations of a crew's journey, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of regenerative practices and contributing to the collective endeavor of building a sustainable and harmonious future.
