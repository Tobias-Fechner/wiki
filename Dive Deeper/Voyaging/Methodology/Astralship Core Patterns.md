A pattern is a set of organising of relationships. In the context of [Fritjof Capra](https://www.fritjofcapra.net/about/)'s work, a pattern refers to recurring structures, processes, or relationships that can be identified across different levels of reality. [^1]

This page aims to help [[Crewing|crew]] get on the same page about the voyaging methodology at the highest level. At this level, some of the core patterns that stand out are:
1. Cohorts
2. [[Voyage]]
3. Voyaging [[Season]]
4. [[Ship]] (academy/ hub)
5. Federating (hub consortiums)

Below is an example of relating the [[Astralship Core Processes]] in an overall voyaging pattern, in keeping with the ship metaphor.
