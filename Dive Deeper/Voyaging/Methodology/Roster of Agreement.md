Is the destination known? Who's the captain for this voyage? What are the roles? 
What core processes will unlock collective flow unique to this constellation of voyagers? What is needed to learn in order to begin living into that? 

The roster of agreement is a symbol of collective will and shared intent. The result of several weeks of field-building, the signing of the roster of agreement is part of the opening ceremony that initiates the voyage. Therefore, the completed roster is a necessary part of [[Boarding]], is the end-state of [[Docking]], and must be complete *before* arrival at the [[Ship]].

There are at least three components that must be included in a roster of agreement: 

1. An *image* that evokes in each of the crew core a sense for the potential they are seeking to realise by voyaging. Each crew core should see in this *image* ways that their essence is required for this *image* to become reality. This is part of the destination of the voyage. This *image* needs to be informed by - or recognise the adaptations needed in order to be informed by - the needs of [[Voyaging and Place|place]]. 
	1. Purpose: creating a source of potential to collectively remember into once the voyaging is underway. 
	2. Products: whether textual, graphical, performative and/or by other means, a product must be presented to [[Astralship]] crew prior to [[Boarding]] the [[Ship]]. See [[Pirating Interview#Onboarding Feed|here]] for an example graphical image that would be suitable to represent e.g. dynamic profile-to-values mapping as an aim of the voyage. 
	3. Process: emergent from the on-boarding calls, guidance toward a roster of agreement will be facilitated by [[Astralship]] crew. 
	4. Functional requirements:
		1. Space for each individual crew core member to be able to reveal their essence the higher purpose of their work.
		2. Sufficient time and scheduling capacity for enough virtual meetings to happen before voyaging begins. 
		3. Means to produce the product: digital skills, coordination among crew core, communication with [[Astralship]] crew for guidance. 
2. A comprehensive account of the existing individual works being pledged into the collective journey. 
	1. Purpose: creating the conditions for trust-full voyaging, making visible collaboration potentials. 
	2. Products: map of network collaboration mutualities and associated NFT collection.
	3. Process: on-boarding calls, network mapping, creation of NFTs with network graphs as metadata. 
	4. Functional requirements: 
		1. Scribe
		2. Resourcing facilitator
		3. [[Pirating Interview]] for each crew core member
		4. NFT release pipeline
3. Initial ship-crew configuration:
	1. Voyage destination (inc. *image* and place-context)
	2. Initial configuration of roles
	3. Voyage needs
