The ship is in the docks, its presence eliciting anticipation for what future journeys it might sail. Passers-by catch a glimpse of activity on the deck and imagine how life might be different if they dared to be... a pirate! 

What adventures would await them?

# Purpose
The purpose of the docking process is to create the space for future [[Astral Alumni]] to be able to explore and develop collaborations prior to the start of a voyage: 
1. [[Pirating]] - discovering the inner pirate (essence discovery)
2. [[Crewing]] - finding common interests, shared aims (guilds)
3. [[Placing]] - connecting with local people, projects, stories, and needs (place)
# Product
The end-product of the process is three-fold: 
1. Pirate profiles (essence reveal)
2. Cohort map (mapping network mutualities)
3. Learning: on-boarding to astral infrastructure
4. Field
# Process
Docking refers to the preparations made whilst the ship is in the docks. This includes the learning journey pirates undergo, to onboard into the Astral (virtual) space. 

To aid with crew self-discovery during and after Docking, voyagers undergo a series of crew calls:
1. Optional: [[Initial Interview]]
	- Short and sweet: 15-minutes to get to know someone
	- Useful for populating their profile
2. [[Pirating Interview]]: Heart, Heart, Hands Onboarding
	- Longer format with more depth
3. [[Collaboration Mapping]]
	- Values map
	- Projects and people connections

Each interview requires an [[Pirating Interview|interview pattern]], and each seeks to produce the artefacts necessary for the mapping.
# Functional Capabilities
Call scheduling will be supported but not administrated. This is required of the crew-to-be to show one another their motivation to discover themselves as a crew. 

Collaboration mapping will be a trustful process, complemented by an NFT collection generated to reflect the pledges and IP of pirate crew. Dream up a voyage destination together, knowing there are attributions of your contributions where due. NFT revenues will contribute toward ship pre-seed funding. 

Call recording, [calendaring](https://cal.com/) and post-processing are foundational capabilities for the docking process.
