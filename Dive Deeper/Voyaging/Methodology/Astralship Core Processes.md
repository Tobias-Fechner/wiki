Imagine the Astralship as a living vessel, powered by the shared purpose of its crew. The Core Processes are our navigational instruments guiding us towards the most impactful regenerative projects. They embody the dynamic spirit of voyaging, reminding us that even our internal workings mirror the adaptability we seek to cultivate in the world.

Like tags that enhance searchability, these processes help us pinpoint essential actions and energy flows. They provide a shared language for our collaborative endeavors and offer a structure that remains fluid, ready to adapt to the ever-changing needs of the voyage.

Core processes are part of what make up the [[Astralship Core Patterns]]. Equivalent to the tags used for Asana pages, the core processes are the energy flows we're lifting into focus that aid people with enacting the voyaging methodology as a living process - animated with the ship and crew metaphors:

1. Needing - expressing needs, eliciting a response from the team and/ or environment. This also acts as a reminder to think of the sites of the Astralship (as well as [[Dive Deeper/Onboarding (Graduating)/Envoices/Crew|Crew]]) as living organisms with needs for their vitality, viability and capacity to evolve. Making visible needs supports the process of realising the conditions needed for these beings to thrive. 
2. [[Docking]]
	1. [[Pirating]] - the making of your pirate self
	2. [[Crewing]] - the process of crew self-discovery
	3. [[Placing]] - connecting with local people, projects, stories, needs
3. [[Boarding]] - all abooooooaaaaaard! Boarding is the point at which crew formation with intent to voyage becomes official. 
5. Viability - funding, resourcing, and anything else related to making projects viable/ sustainable. See [[On-Boarding Resonant Lines of Work]].
6. Delivering - in focus as a team commitment to making it happen.
7. [[Sociocratic Decisions|Deciding]] - requires the following of a decision-making process to go from current state of clarity and coherence around the achievement of a need/desire to having it be powered by the collective will - either through delegation, decentralization or consensus.
