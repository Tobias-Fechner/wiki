# Interview Pattern
We don't know what will come up in interviews, nor [[Astralship Core Patterns|how things will evolve from there]], but we do know that we're aiming to create the conditions for effective [[Crewing|crewing]]: thriving co-learning and [[Provocation|provocation]]s. To this end, we've created a prototype pattern that can be used during interviews. This pattern relates:
1. Evolution of work
2. Pirate essence
3. Systems (wholes)
4. Systems potential
5. Voyaging aims (destination)
6. Potential restraints
7. Potential reconciliation
# Onboarding Feed
If enacting ancient and emerging paradigms requires trying out new forms/ new shapes,[^1] and voyages are making a contribution toward this as learning-by-being experiences, the [[Onboarding Feed]] is one of the ways we'd like to share that learning journey.

Over time, we'll be nestling and entangling this media among our multi-media [[Voyaging Platform]]. Above shows a sketch for inspiration.
