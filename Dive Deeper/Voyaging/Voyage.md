The purpose of our voyaging [[Astralship Core Patterns|methodology]] and [[Astral Infrastructure|infrastructure]] is to create the conditions and capabilities needed for greater orders of collaboration on regenerative systems-change work. 

Our process is to embody these practices daily, and invite others to join as a learning-by-being experience.

Concretely, we facilitate by means of a physical hackerspace, complemented by our [[Voyage Products|publishing engine]] to make visible the learnings of the collaborations. Living at [[Astralship]], our work is energised by our love for the region of [[Deiniolen|Gwynedd]], and we seek to ground voyaging processes in local partnerships and pilots - see [[Voyaging and Place]].

The products of our voyaging are [[Voyage Products|provocations]] (see also [[Crewing]]). Provocations are ["poetry from the future,"](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/5c06c3af-3cf6-43fc-8055-bf77de191607) hinting toward systems change potential and/ or radically shaking the foundations of prevailing orders.
