The team is organising a season of voyages, inviting from across their combined networks. Energies are attracted around each voyage by a theme. These are like strange attractors in a complex system, characterising its quality. Voyaging begins with building the resonance between these otherwise disparate fragments of conversation. We're beginning this process by [[Pirating Interview|conducting interviews]] with voyage stakeholders. Practically, we're working to support this process with an [[Astral Infrastructure|integrated digital collaboration infrastructure]], combining: tasking (Asana), writing (Wikis), comms (Telegram) and media production. This is the abstract collective intelligence that complements the co-living exchanges. This infrastructure is also our instrument needed to make the educational content from the voyaging, which is one of the ways we aim to [[Voyaging Value Creation|sustain]] our operation.
# Season Overview
A season is comprised of a number of [[Voyage|voyages]], where each resembles a quality that's characteristic of the season as a whole. These voyages are guided by and contribute to meeting the needs of the whole that the season is in service to.

# Season Governance
A season begins with the following two conditions: 
1. A set of needs requires more than one voyage to be met;
2. A common thread underlying several voyages evokes the self-organising of a group of people to steward its process of becoming. 

Those stewards are responsible for creating the conditions necessary for the season to thrive. This may include resourcing the design thinking, contributing with fundraising efforts, and helping broadcast the voyages to networks to find fellow voyagers. 

In playing an essential role in the activation of the season as a whole, its stewards are responsible for sensing into the translation between the voyaging and broader contexts - markets, narratives, networks etc. Effective engagement across these contexts is necessary to ensure the viability of the ongoing development of the season's products. Without such factors being taken into account, steps toward the purpose of season will not be sustained beyond the culmination of the season's voyages. The season steward circle may seek to sustain such efforts by means of:

1. Access support, such as streamlining various channel flows, e.g. projects and funders
2. Consultation, such as by offering insight into the development of the season's product ecosystem, and/or the utilisation of season products within a given content
3. Educational programmes and content
4. Integration across season products in a single interface
5. Co-creating something entirely novel
