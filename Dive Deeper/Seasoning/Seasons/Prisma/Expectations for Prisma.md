# Expectations
Communities of Practice doing regenerative development work need a way to communicate regenerative development, regeneratively. The purpose of this season is to contribute toward the creation of a platform that enables the work of regenerative development to be carried forward with paradigm integrity, developed further through application, evaluated, and for the platform to evolve with it ([[Prisma Page 3]] & [[Prisma Page 4|4]]): 

1. Carried forward with paradigm integrity: for the work to be truly in alignment with living systems evolving uniquely to their highest order of potential, and to reflect all principles of regenerative development practice, inc. ([[Prisma Page 4|4]]):
	1. Essence
	2. Wholes
	3. Developmental
	4. Potential
	5. Field-growing (relational)
2. Developed further through application: that the practice applied in place ([[Prisma Page 6|6]]) helps inform how the practice needs to evolve ([[Prisma Page 7|7]]); that the platform supports the community acting as a resource to one another, to steward one another's work and the practice as a living lineage, decentralising the role currently played by the institute faculty ([[Prisma Page 2|2]]). 
3. Evaluated: to also be able to make visible the common thread underlying each unique application ([[Prisma Page 7|7]]); to be able to sense where applications of the practice are thriving; for the process of sensing to lift the unique expression of this work in this place (not homogenise) and support the depth of its essence (not flatten/ reduce); and for these success cases to be made visible through the platform. 
4. Success cases to be made visible: for unique expressions of the work to be able to attract resourcing through the platform. 
5. For the platform to evolve with it: for the evolution of the role the platform plays to not be dependent on a single individual/ team/ organisation evolving it ([[Prisma Page 4|4]], [[Prisma Page 10|10]], [[Prisma Page 11|11]]).

From the perspective of a community of practice, it needs to be able to see itself, know of itself and its needs, and sense its impact, potential, and ways it can grow.
