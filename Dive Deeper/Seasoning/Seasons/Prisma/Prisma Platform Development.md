The development of the platform needs to be an autopoietic process in itself, happening with the work it aims to serve: tangible applications of regenerative development. As such, the development of the platform needs to be an evolutionary learning journey, based in [[Voyaging and Place|place]], demonstrating [[The Prisma Season#A Season of Interconnected Voyages|multiple dimensions]] of regenerative capacity building. It needs to engage communities of practice and place in the development of its initial features, and the development process needs to be a process that creates value across multiple [[Stakeholder Scales|scales]]: practitioners, learning hubs,[^1] and a network of learning hubs building regenerative capacity locally. This is where [[Astralship|Astralship]] and the [[Voyage|voyages]] have an important role to play, intersecting these different requirements and capabilities. Thus, the core of the opportunity is the co-evolutionary partnerships forming among regenerative development projects, "prismando" design input, and infrastructure providers.

The role of the [[The Prisma Season|season]] team is to steward the evolution of the "prismando" [[Voyaging Value Creation#Incubating Consortiums around Multiple Lines of Work|ecosystem]] as a whole toward higher orders of capability and potential, in service to work of regenerators, learning and life. 

Our opportunity is to present to suitable partners the voyaging hackathons and existing work (more partners) as a means to deliver these integrations, and to deliver to these communities of practice the capabilities outlined above: 

1. Multiple dimensions: knowledge, networks, impact, stories, resources
2. Multiple scales: place-based project, community of regenerative practitioners, network of different learning hubs
3. Evolution: all of the above undergoing inter-related evolutionary learning journeys

Existing works are extensive. Yet, this will still be a creation process. There are needs unique to any given project, which will require different pieces of the existing work, glue to stick them together, and probably (hopefully!) entirely new pieces. Our aim with the Astralship voyaging is to attract the pieces, piece-makers and gluers (developers, designers, facilitators) into an environment where the most beautiful expression of collaboration can emerge. The aim of the joint fundraise between these partners is to co-market this process, attracting the needed energies, and to co-develop these elements/ configurations that are unique to the Prisma concept. The larger aim is for this development to build clarity and/ or infrastructure that supports the underlying patterning of these processes (regenerative development) to be carried out in other places, by other practitioners.

In summary: 
1. Core season partners: practice, community, funding (goal and proximate whole)
2. Astralship: technical capabilities, case study, field-building environment (ground and instrument)
3. Technical partners: existing works, infrastructure, capabilities and networks (greater whole and instruments)
4. [[Season]] team: project delivery (direction, system evolution)
