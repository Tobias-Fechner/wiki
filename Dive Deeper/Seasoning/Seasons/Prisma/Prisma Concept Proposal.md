The concept proposed is a means to create an evolving information space, with practitioners at the centre ([[Prisma Page 9|9]]). Like visiting different planets in a galaxy, navigating this information space should be like travelling across highly unique contexts, each with its own presence, and each inquiry requiring a sensitive approach ([[Prisma Page 13|13]]). Each journey is guided by the integrations employed and/ or built by the communities communicating that work: guided through developmental communication journeys ([[Prisma Page 10|10]]). The attempt to communicate the essence of the work is the will-generator, re-engaging practitioners with the platform: essentialising across the high-dimensional information space to speak into existence the underlying patterns that are characterising its evolution, and/ or the patterns in potential ([[Prisma Page 9|9]] & [[Prisma Page 10|10]]). It is developmental to navigate, and developmental to publish content that tries to communicate their unique systems-change work. Once published, its effects changes the context, always in evolution ([[Prisma Page 9|9]]). The platform content is the interface between communicators and communicatees: the communicated ([[Prisma Page 8|8]]). The potential for this platform to be making a unique contribution complementary to existing platforming/ mapping/ digital communing efforts is the design work put in to the build of the platform itself. Built by the care of regenerative practitioners, for regenerative practitioners. Communicatees could be other practitioners, and therefore serve the process of forming teams and supporting one another's work. Communicatees could also be other stakeholders in this work, including faculty and funders ([[Prisma Page 12|12]]). One of the principle aims of our core partners is to be able to assess how to most effectively allocate fellowships - i.e. nodal interventions to catalyse systems-change. Generalised, this becomes a means for those doing regenerative work to be able to attract much needed funding. In this way, the role of the platform is to create the multiple perspectives and learning capabilities necessary for the needs of regenerative development work to be expressed and met ([[Prisma Page 14|14]]).
