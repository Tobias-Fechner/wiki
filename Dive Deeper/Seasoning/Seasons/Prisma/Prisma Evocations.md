How is the role of regenerative communication different from functional communication? How would navigating an ecosystem of work need to look different to be developmental ([[Prisma Page 12|12]])? How would stewarding the development of a technical project be different if the products of that process needed to create the conditions for unimaginably diverse gestures toward an infinite abundance of unique potentials ([[Prisma Page 4|4]])? How would the quality of its products need to be different if each were making a contribution to growing revitalising fields of work ([[Prisma Page 4|4]])? Each fielding process unique, and each playing a needed role for the creation of a whole beyond themselves? A whole in potential? 
So, the categorised processes ([[Prisma Page 6|6]]) and structures ([[Prisma Page 7|7]]) that reflect *some* possible dimensions of enacting and evaluating regenerative development, respectively, are not the project to be developed (knowledge-commoning, land-relating, networking, storying, resourcing). The project to be developed is the underlying pattern that can consistently evolve and be of service to the place-unique assemblages (integrations, APIs) of a possible infinity of processes and structures involved in regenerative development work - and for this pattern to be useful in both application and communication ([[Prisma Page 8|8]]).
