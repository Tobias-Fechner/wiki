**interested in**: 
how information moves from A to B between individuals, ecosystems, societies, computer systems, brains and bodies. staring at complex systems and see how they work and stretch consciousness behind the daily perception of reality. figuring out what it is to be human, thinking of how to hack, cleverly misuse, and rewrite social rules, and wondering why rational creatures so often act against their own best interests. answering the question of why human decision-making systems feel so broken, and what are the incentives and mechanisms, social and biological, that are guide faulty decision-making.

**latest mission**: 
the most important and urgent challenge of mankind is the exponential growth in our capacity to do things, and making sure we do the right things. making sure we built technology that augments, rather than impairs, flourishing of conscious beings. making sure we can transcend predatory and extractive business models before we’re all converted into passive consumers of a narrative not created by, and for, us.

**worldview**: 
non-dualist and non-anthropocentric. gamithra recognizes no fundamental difference between genders, people of different origins, work-life vs. non-work-life, humans vs. conscious beings, evil vs. suffering, human intelligence vs. artificial intelligence, software vs. hammers. it’s all the same thing, it’s all impermanent and it’s all beautiful 

**values**: guidelines.gamithra.com

**favourite technologies**: dishwashers, liquid democracy, and Windows XP
  
**least favourite things**: ignorance, absence of awareness, lack of clarity, unwillingness to engage with complexities
