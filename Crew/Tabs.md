Tobias, also known as Tabs, is an English-German regeneration pilgrim, born in Leeds who grew up in the south-west of England, near Avebury.

It turned out to be disillusioning. 

After that, I joined [Farad.ai](https://www.farad.ai/), a renewable energy startup in London as employee #2, and started learning about grid flexibility.

At the time, Farad.ai was developing Bayesian-based predictive modelling of grid capacity to locate connection points for low-carbon installations (wind, solar, EV chargers etc.):

That went relatively well but I needed to finish school, so I moved to Barcelona, worked online for a small [Berlin-based team](https://www.edf-re.de/unsere-aktivit%C3%A4ten/batteriespeicher) building software to analyse power usage of industrial sites and determine the sizing of batteries used to shift their usage profile (grid flexibility):

This also turned out to be disillusioning and lead to what became 8 months of research, culminating in identifying Nature-based Solutions as a step "beyond carbon," and the process bottleneck of monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV). 

I left EDF, and joined [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/) Berlin to find a co-founder. (Somewhere in between I had moved to Berlin.)

The hypothesis was that crowdsourcing this process could find ground in the emerging carbon credits market, translating to capital-holders, whilst at the same time being an intervention in the false dichotomy of humans vs. living planet. Learning of VC culture and those happy to contribute to it made this a relatively swift chapter.

As a result, I began networking much more online, learned of the word "regeneration," took [1](https://www.regenerat.es/trp), [2](https://systemicdesignlabs.ethz.ch/drrs/), [3](https://uci.ac.cr/certificate-regenerative-entrepreneurship/) courses on regenerative design, one on [token engineering](https://tokenengineering.net/), and hit the trail to hike 6 weeks/ 800km along the north-coast of the Iberian Peninsula, naturally.

Over the following months I worked closely with [SEEDS](https://joinseeds.earth/) and [Hypha](https://hypha.earth/), learning about land-based DAOs and digital currencies in general, sustained myself freelancing (just about), and contributed to various other projects: 
1. [RA365](https://www.omdena.com/blog/satellite-imagery-solar) - an NGO deploying solar power units to small-scale farmers in Nigeria
2. Voluntaire.net - a capacity-needs matching site in response to the influx of Ukrainian refugees arriving in Berlin (1000 /day) after invasion by Russia
3. [MoM DAO](https://dao.hypha.earth/momdho/organization) - the movement of movements within regeneration 
4. [Wildtrips](https://authenticitys.com/en/about-us/) - regenerative travel
5. [Wada](https://www.wada.org/) (current) - a network of learning hubs across Africa with a focus on decentralised technologies

â€¦ which brought me all the way out to Costa Rica!

This marked the beginning of a transition from trying to be proper, toward... something else. The pilgrimage continues. Ongoing learnings include: 

1. DAOs  ([1](https://hypha.earth/), [2](https://www.commonsstack.org/), [3](https://regen.foundation/)) and [Holochain](https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/1_the_basics/)
2. Community Land Trusts ([1](https://eco-socialism.org/), [2](https://recommon.land/))
3. Regenerative design and development
4. Living Systems and more broadly [Complexity Science](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/)
6. Narrative-based social change/ cultural evolution ([1](https://culturehack.io/))
7. Awareness-based systems change ([1](https://www.regenerat.es/trp), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alif_ObQzMw), [3](https://presencinginstitute.org/))
8. [Bioregioning](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10548)
9. [Living labs](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-71059-4_74-1), [hackerspaces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733322001962), [regen villages](https://issuu.com/theweavemagazine/docs/tw_03_final/2), bioregional learning centres etc.
