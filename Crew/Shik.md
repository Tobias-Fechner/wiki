Namaste Mitra~

(I bow to you, my friend). Thank you for being curious about who I am.

Born and brought up in military bases around India, I left an undergraduate business education to study the liberal arts and ended up with BA in Environmental Studies. I am a serial-*starter* and have built communities of practice around climate justice, environmental governance, youth activist resourcing in India, Singapore, the Netherlands, and remotely. These experiences have taught me that my role in a collective is that of a coordinator/facilitator/energizer. As such, my primary skill-set is that of structuring, researching, communicating and holding space - a generalist. 

Being part of the regenerative movement necessitates putting faith in something - and I put mine in the power of communing. People coming together from across all sorts of boundaries to pursue a shared seeking - in our case, a compassionate civilization - is the most beautiful *and* powerful act of creation. That is why I part of the Astralship Project - to forge new frontiers of collaborative innovation in the face of wickedly complex problems to solve.

Currently, I am occupying the [[Navigator]] role - drafting the maps and helping the collective compass needle point towards business viability and voyage delivery for this year. I have served as [[Captain]], [[Cook]] and [[Engineer]] in the past as well - depending on what the ship needed.  

Apart from my role onboard the Phoenix, I am working on a number of other projects:
- GreenCheck: redirecting resources to frontline community-led climate action
- Foundations Earth: unveiling stories and shared experiences around sense-making about our civilizational transition 
- Care Circles: catalysing community through building online spaces of belonging, authenticity and mutual support
- Institute of Coordination: providing infrastructure for values-aligned freelancers and professionals to take on projects as teams
