Liam Kurmos, a native of Wales, grew up immersed in the natural beauty of Anglesey, where his early years were spent roaming fields, climbing trees, and exploring the digital realms of a ZX Spectrum on his family's organic farm. This blend of rural life and early technological engagement laid the groundwork for what would become a diverse and impactful career.  
  
In 1995, Liam embarked on a journey of academic and personal exploration at the University of Sussex, where he pursued a degree in Physics with a minor in Japanese. This unique combination of studies not only broadened his scientific horizons but also opened the door to a multi-year stay in Japan. There, he achieved fluency in Japanese, absorbing the culture and technological innovations that would later influence his professional endeavors.  
  
Liam's academic pursuits continued at Uppsala University in Sweden, where he contributed to research utilizing data from a neutrino telescope in Antarctica. His insatiable curiosity and dedication to science led him back to Sussex for a Master's in Particle Cosmology, further deepening his understanding of the universe's fundamental forces and structures.  
  
The subsequent decade saw Liam traversing Asia, where his experiences further enriched his worldview. This period of exploration was a precursor to his venture into Computer Science through a funded Master's program at Bangor University. It was here that Liam began to meld his diverse interests and skills, working on funded projects and lecturing while initiating a PhD in Computational Topology and launching a software startup.  
  
In 2017, Liam's journey culminated in the founding of the AstralShip project, a visionary initiative aimed at fostering high-impact innovation through a regenerative lens. The project draws inspiration from a myriad of sources that have shaped Liam's path: the holistic science perspectives of Fritjof Capra, his experiences with the forward-thinking Japanese software company Dream Access, the conceptual designs of Project Mind—an unfulfilled venture into Lurianic Kabbalah and innovation incubation—and a transformative sailing trip to Ireland with his friend Mike in 2010.  
  
The AstralShip project is more than an innovation hub; it is a testament to Liam's belief in the power of human consciousness to transcend existential risks and forge a regenerative planetary society. Through intense effort of heart and creative mind, Liam believes in a world where innovation, community, and sustainability converge to create a bright future for humanity.  
  
Liam Kurmos is not just a scientist, entrepreneur, or explorer; he is a pioneer at the intersection of technology, spirituality, and environmental stewardship. His leadership of the AstralShip project embodies a commitment to leveraging human ingenuity and compassion to navigate the challenges of our time, steering us toward a harmonious and sustainable global community.
