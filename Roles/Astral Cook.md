The Astral Cook is the grounding force for viability and well-being.

Aboard the Phoenix, Cooks are the nurturing force, dedicated to creating and maintaining spaces of vitality and harmony for the whole crew. Given the vast expanses charted by our voyages, the Cook's responsibilities range from ensuring sustenance of the crew both virtual and physical to supporting individual members with their personal development while onboard.

Cooks tend to have a sensitive and magnanimous personality - they sense tensions within and between people easily. They have also undertaken self-work to understand their own boundaries and how to hold safe space for others. Apart from having a broad idea of how cooking and health science works, a Cook’s primary attribute is firmness - they should be willing and able to drop the anchor at any point where crew vitality is endangered by lack of resources or processes going awry. 

Some examples of the Cook’s tasks are as below:

##### When onboard the physical Astralship:
- **Meal Planning and Preparation:** Physically plan and prepare nutritious meals, adapting recipes based on crew dietary needs. Engage in hands-on cooking sessions, ensuring everyone is well-fed and satisfied.
- **Team Circles and Check-ins:** Organize in-person team-wide circles to foster open communication and connection. Conduct face-to-face one-on-one check-ins, focusing on crew members' well-being and building strong interpersonal relationships.
- **Onboarding and Security:** Physically receive and onboard new crew members and voyagers, ensuring a smooth transition. Oversee ship security measures, implementing safety protocols to maintain a secure environment.
- **Operational Management:** Manage physical ship materials, including supplies and inventory. Maintain cleanliness through physical oversight, run a tight ship!

##### When performing a virtual role:
- **Validating Ship Sustainability** Ensuring that the basic needs of all crew members are being met by the strategic and tactical activities being undertaken by the ship - particularly around financial security, food and shelter, and stress/anxiety levels.
- **Supporting Personal Development:** Work with crew members to understand and address specific areas of growth like mental health, fitness, upskilling etc. Facilitate online personal development workshops and skill-sharing sessions for remote crew members. 
- **Team Circles and Check-ins:** Conduct virtual team-wide circles to maintain open communication and connection, especially for remote crew. Facilitate one-on-one online check-ins, focusing on crew members' well-being and maintaining a supportive virtual environment.
